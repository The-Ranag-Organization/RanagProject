## What is Ranag
Ranag is an completely open source terminal assistant and file manager that help you debug and manage your code easily, it was created by me, Wormfryes and is being mantained by me, feel free to join the contribuitors team and help me with this monumental project.


## How to Install

You can install Ranag via Releases by clicking [Here](https://github.com/Wormfryes/RanagProject/releases/),  
or clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wormfryes/RanagProject/
```
It is recommended to download via Releases, as if you compile the repository locally, you will need to insert your Hugging Face token (from huggingface.co) in the APIKEY.txt file.
The pre-built executable is ready to use out of the box.

## How to Use

To use Ranag, you need an internet connection to interact with Hugging Face. Please note that this will be modified in the future for Ranag to work locally. We are still in the early stages of development.

Simply run the executable you downloaded/generated from your terminal.
### •	On Windows:
```bash
.\executableName
```

### •	On Linux:
```bash
./executableName
```

Upon running it, you’ll be greeted with a message and an input asking you to specify your operating system.
This is used to ensure that the AI runs compatible commands for your terminal.

After that, you will see a > prompt on your screen, indicating you can start interacting with the AI and request it to execute commands.
For example, you can ask it to create a React JS project.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the project by creating an issue if you’d like to become a contributor or if you encounter a problem with the AI. Your feedback will help improve the project.
